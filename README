Write Introduction here


Installation
============

Install requirements:
-Valid install of trilinos with Kokkos and Tpetra packages enabled.
	(Tpetra requirement will be removed when KokkosCrsMatrix is moved out of Tpetra)
-CMake Version 2.8 or newer (Looking into making it a lower version)
-OpenMP (Not directly used but Kokkos can use this.)

To Install:
-In the top level CMakeLists file you need to change the Trilinos_PREFIX
  to the PREFIX you used to install trilinos.
-In the top level CMakeLists file you need to change the Definition towards the bottom to
	specify where you want the execution_space to be set to
-For out of source build, call cmake <location_of_top_level_HPCG> 
  from the directory you'd like to build from
-DONT FORGET THE FLAG -KOKKOS_OPENMP = ON or -KOKKOS_CUDA = ON if you forget it runs with Kokkos::Serial
-For in source build, call cmake .
-Then call make and this should build everything. The executable KokkosHPCG.exe
  will be located in the src directory

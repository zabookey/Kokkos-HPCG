HPCG with Kokkos Implementation
###############################

Introduction
============

Write Introduction here


Installation
============

Install requirements:
-Valid install of trilinos with Kokkos package enabled
-CMake Version 2.8 or newer (Looking into making it a lower version)
-OpenMP (I'm working on getting rid of this)

To Install:
-In the top level CMakeLists file you need to change the Trilinos_PREFIX
  to the PREFIX you used to install trilinos.
-For out of source build, call cmake <location_of_top_level_HPCG> 
  from the directory you'd like to build from
-DONT FORGET THE FLAG -KOKKOS_OPENMP = ON or -KOKKOS_CUDA = ON if you forget it runs with Kokkos::Serial
-For in source build, call cmake .
-Then call make and this should build everything. The executable KokkosHPCG.exe
  will be located in the src directory

Known Issues
============

Top Priority

Will not function properly on Cuda, a couple of parallel functions either need to be serialized (bad)
or have their lambdas rewritten to use [=] as their capture list. Due to this, GenerateProblem currently
runs in serial.

hwloc function doesn't seem to give me the correct number of threads.

\begin{abstract}
Unlike many other baked goods, chocolate pudding is subject to a myriad of interesting (and unique) effects on both the
meso and nano scales.  Understanding these phenomena is critical, not only to America's restaurant industry, but to
children everywhere.  We intend to examine these effects and propose new potential models which accurately capture the
material structure of chocolate pudding.

\section{Introduction} \label{ZAB:sec:intro}
I like chocolate pudding.  For that matter everyone else does too. This relationship is captured in \eqref{ZAB:eq:one},
\begin{equation}\label{ZAB:eq:one}
f(x) = x^{100-d},
\end{equation}
where $f$ is happiness in utils, $x$ is the quantity of chocolate pudding consumed in ounces and $d$ is the age of the
subject in years.

It has been argued that that chocolate pudding consumption by age is shown in Figure \ref{ZAB:fig:Mentor05}.  However,
we propose an alternative pudding consumption model, shown in Figure \ref{ZAB:fig:cos}.

We also want to show these figures side by side, to better illustrate our comparison.  We can see this in Figures
\ref{ZAB:fig:comp1} and \ref{ZAB:fig:comp2}.

\section{Actual Content}

As we saw in Section \ref{ZAB:sec:intro}, we all like chocolate pudding. This is where I wish
\textsf{$\setminus$jargonfill} worked. It would fill the page with meaningless technobabble so I could illustrate this
package. Instead, I'll talk about how to use quotations in latex. "Never use these quotations." ``Always use these,
instead.''

\section{Conclusions}
Herein, we repeat the abstract in past tense.

Unlike many other baked goods, chocolate pudding is subject to a myriad of interesting (and unique) effects on both the
meso and nano scales.  Understanding these phenomena is critical, not only to America's restaurant industry, but to
children everywhere.  We have examined these effects and have proposed new potential models which accurately capture
the material structure of chocolate pudding.
